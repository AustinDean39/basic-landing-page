# basic-landing-page
A generic landing page for a website

In this project, I will be attempting to recreate a landing page for a website, based off of an image. I will be using my intermeditate knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a web page as close to the image as I can.

For reference and context, here are the two images given at the beginning of the project:

Image of web page to recreate:

Colors and font styles:
